This is a Toptal excercise project based on the following requirements:

Write an application for the input of calories

User must be able to create an account and log in
When logged in, user can see a list of his meals and calories (user enters calories manually, no auto calculations!), also hw should be able to edit and delete
Each entry has a date, time, text, and num of calories
Filter by dates from-to, time from-to (e.g. how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month, if lunch is between 12 and 15h)
User setting – Expected number of calories per day
When displayed, it goes green if the total for that day is less than expected number of calories per day, otherwise goes red
Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
